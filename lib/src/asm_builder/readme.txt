Welcome to the cheap ass asm builder ;)

This is only convenience classes/objects that build a string to be passed to the keystone
engine through the KsAsm exported binding.

This reduce syntax error when compared to writing raw assembler instruction, tho.

Add your syntax by extending the AsmBuilderBase located in the asm_builder_base.dart file.
